      <ul>
        <li>
          Started educational journey at Mt.Hood Community College. Initially I
          went for a cyber security certificate, and eventually I decided on a
          transfer in Computer Science
        </li>
        <li>
          The start of what has been over a decade of Customer Service was 5
          years of work at Regal Entertainment Group.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next longest streak of customer service and retail was 4.5 years
          at Costco where I not only got to experience many of the faces of
          working in retail, but also got to refine my ability to handle
          adversity as I was an essential worker through the beginning of Covid.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Began the second half of my education in 2021–2022, where I built a
          strong foundation in C++—progressing from core syntax to advanced data
          structures and memory management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Through mid-level coursework, I explored the theoretical side of
          computer science with a focus on algorithms, systems programming, and
          my first practical experience in software development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toward the end of my degree, I found my strongest interest and success
          in Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, and Object-Oriented Programming.

      <h2>Current Journey</h2>

    <div class="about-me-description">
      <p>
        I now have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Once I finished my
        degree I began going on the hunt for work, finding the professional
        world new and arduous terrain. <br />
        <br />I currently am working on a portfolio and skillset that surrounds
        full stack development. During my time in school I learned a
        considerable amount about Backend and Cloud development as well.<br />
        <br />The goal I will be working towards is not only a Backend/Full
        Stack Dev, but also a Computer Science Educator. With that I will also
        be pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science to start that journey.
